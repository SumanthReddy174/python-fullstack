 Exception Handling


31. Write code to handle division by zero with try-except.


try:
    result = 10 / 0
except Exception as e:
    print("An error occurred:", e)
 


try = “Try to run this.”

🚨 except = “If it fails, do this instead.”

✅ Helps your program not crash even if something goes wrong.
