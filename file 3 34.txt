34. Write code that handles multiple exceptions (e.g., `ZeroDivisionError`, `ValueError`).


What Are Multiple Exceptions?

When you run a program, different types of errors can happen.
👉 Example:

Dividing by zero → ZeroDivisionError

Entering letters instead of numbers → ValueError

Code Example
try:
    num1 = int(input("Enter the numerator: "))
    num2 = int(input("Enter the denominator: "))
    result = num1 / num2
    print("Result:", result)

except ZeroDivisionError:
    print("❌ You can’t divide by zero!")

except ValueError:
    print("❌ Please enter only numbers, not letters!")

except Exception as e:
    print("⚠️ Something went wrong:", e)

print("✅ Program continues smoothly...")

🧾 Example Runs
🧩 Case 1: Divide by Zero
Enter the numerator: 10
Enter the denominator: 0
❌ You can’t divide by zero!
✅ Program continues smoothly...

🧩 Case 2: Invalid Input
Enter the numerator: hello
❌ Please enter only numbers, not letters!
✅ Program continues smoothly...

🧩 Case 3: Works Fine
Enter the numerator: 8
Enter the denominator: 2
Result: 4.0
✅ Program continues smoothly...

🪄 Step-by-Step Explanation

try:
→ Code that might fail (like division or converting to int).

except ZeroDivisionError:
→ Runs if user divides by zero.

except ValueError:
→ Runs if user enters something that’s not a number.

except Exception as e:
→ Catches any other unexpected error.

The program doesn’t crash — it keeps going! 🚀
