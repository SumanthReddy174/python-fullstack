27. Write a generator function that yields even numbers up to `n`.


What is a Generator?

A generator is like a machine that gives one value at a time — not all at once.
It’s made using the yield keyword instead of return.


program


def even_numbers(n):
    for i in range(2, n + 1, 2):  # start from 2, go till n, step by 2
        yield i  # give one even number at a time


# Using the generator
for num in even_numbers(10):
    print(num)
