28. Implement a generator that yields Fibonacci numbers.




def fibonacci(n):
    a, b = 0, 1   # first two Fibonacci numbers
    for _ in range(n):
        yield a    # give the current number
        a, b = b, a + b  # move to the next two numbers


# Use the generator
for num in fibonacci(10):
    print(num)
