29. Write a generator that reads a large file line by line


If you try to read a large file (like 1GB!) all at once, Python will try to store it in memory 💾 — and your program might crash 😬.

A generator helps you read one line at a time, so it saves memory and works faster. ⚡

✅ Example: Generator to Read a File
def read_file_line_by_line(filename):
    with open(filename, "r") as file:  # open the file safely
        for line in file:              # loop through each line
            yield line.strip()         # give one line at a time (remove \n)




Step-by-Step Explanation

def read_file_line_by_line(filename): → define a generator function.

with open(filename, "r") as file: → opens the file safely (it will close automatically).

for line in file: → loops through one line at a time.

yield line.strip() → gives one clean line (removes \n) each time.

The loop in the main program gets one line per iteration — without loading the whole file! 🧠
