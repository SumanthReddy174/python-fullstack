35. Implement a safe file reader that handles `FileNotFoundError`.

def safe_file_reader(filename):
    try:
        # Try to open and read the file
        with open(filename, 'r') as file:
            content = file.read()
            print("📘 File content:\n", content)

    except FileNotFoundError:
        # Handles case where the file is missing
        print(f"❌ Error: The file '{filename}' was not found.")

    except Exception as e:
        # Handles any other unexpected error
        print("⚠️ Some other error occurred:", e)

    else:
        print("✅ File read successfully!")

    finally:
        print("🔚 File operation completed.")






Step-by-Step Explanation

try:

We attempt to open the file using with open(filename, 'r').

with automatically closes the file after reading (even if an error occurs).

except FileNotFoundError:

If the file doesn’t exist, this block executes and shows a user-friendly message.

except Exception as e:

Handles any other possible errors (like permission issues).

else:

Runs only if no exception occurs — means file opened successfully.

finally:

Runs always, whether there’s an error or not — good for cleanup or messages.
