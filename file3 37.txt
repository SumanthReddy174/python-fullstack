37. Implement a decorator that counts how many times a function is called.

What is this decorator for?

It helps us know how many times a function has been executed.
Each time we call the function, the counter increases.

✅ Program: Function Call Counter
def count_calls(func):
    count = 0  # Initialize counter

    def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
        nonlocal count  # allows us to modify 'count' from outer function
        count += 1
        print(f"Function '{func.__name__}' called {count} times")
        return func(*args, **kwargs)  # Call the original function
    return wrapper

🧩 Step-by-Step Explanation

count_calls(func) → decorator function that takes another function as input.

count = 0 → keeps track of how many times the function is called.

wrapper() → inner function that:

Increases the count each time it runs.

Prints how many times the function has been called.

Runs the original function.

nonlocal count → allows the inner function to modify count from the outer scope.

return wrapper → sends back the modified function.

🎯 Example Usage
@count_calls
def greet(name):
    print(f"Hello, {name}!")

greet("Alice")
greet("Bob")
greet("Charlie")

🧾 Output
Function 'greet' called 1 times
Hello, Alice!
Function 'greet' called 2 times
Hello, Bob!
Function 'greet' called 3 times
Hello, Charlie!
