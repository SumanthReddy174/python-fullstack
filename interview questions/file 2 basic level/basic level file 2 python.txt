1. What are Pythonâ€™s key features?
*Python is an easy-to-learn, high-level, and interpreted language.
*It is dynamically typed and handles memory automatically.
*Python supports multiple styles like functions, OOP, and functional programming.
*It is cross-platform, open-source, and has a huge library + community support.

2. Why is Python called an interpreted language?
Python is called interpreted because the code is executed line by line by the Python interpreter, 
without needing to be compiled into machine code first.

3. What happens if indentation is incorrect in Python?
Indentation = spaces at the start of a line (used to define blocks like loops, if, functions).
If indentation is wrong, Python raises an IndentationError (or sometimes unexpected behavior).
Example (wrong indentation):
if True:
print("Hello")   #  IndentationError

Correct version:
if True:
    print("Hello")   #  works fine
4. What are Python keywords? Can you use them as variable names?
Python keywords are reserved words that have special meaning in the language. You cannot use them as variable names.
Examples: if, else, for, while, def, class, import, return, try, except.
