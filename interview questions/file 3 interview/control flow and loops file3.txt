11. Print the Fibonacci sequence up to `n` terms.

def fibonacci(n):
    a, b = 0, 1  # start with first two numbers
    for i in range(n):
        print(a, end=" ")  # print current number
        a, b = b, a + b    # update to next two numbers

# Test
fibonacci(10)



Step-by-step explanation:

Start with two numbers → a = 0, b = 1.

Print a.

Then make a take b’s value, and b become the sum of both.

Repeat this for n terms.
