17. Implement a recursive function to calculate factorial.
What is Factorial?

Factorial of a number n (written as n!) = n Ã— (n-1) Ã— (n-2) Ã— ... Ã— 1

Example:

5! = 5 Ã— 4 Ã— 3 Ã— 2 Ã— 1 = 120
0! = 1 (by definition)

ðŸ”¹ What is Recursion?

Recursion = a function that calls itself.

Think of it like stacking boxes: solve the top box, then the next, until the last box.


program
def factorial(n):
    if n == 0 or n == 1:  # base case
        return 1
    else:
        return n * factorial(n - 1)  # recursive call

# Test
print(factorial(5))  # 120
print(factorial(0))  # 1
