15. Find all numbers between 1 and 100 divisible by both 3 and 5.


Step 1:

If a number is divisible by both 3 and 5,
it means it must be divisible by their Least Common Multiple (LCM).

LCM of 3 and 5 = 15

ðŸ‘‰ So we need numbers that are multiples of 15.

ðŸ§® Step 2:

Now we check numbers from 1 to 100.

Multiples of 15 are:

15, 30, 45, 60, 75, 90

ðŸ’» Step 3: Write the Python code
for i in range(1, 101):  # numbers from 1 to 100
    if i % 3 == 0 and i % 5 == 0:  # divisible by both 3 and 5
        print(i)

ðŸ§¾ Output:
15
30
45
60
75
90

âœ… Explanation (simple words):

The loop checks each number from 1 to 100.

If a number divides exactly by 3 and 5 (no remainder), it prints it.

These are the numbers that are divisible by both 3 and 5.
