22. Implement inheritance with a base class `Shape` and derived classes `Circle` and `Rectangle` with an `area()` method.


What is Inheritance?

Inheritance means one class (child) can use features of another class (parent).
ðŸ‘‰ Child inherits properties and methods from the parent.

Example:

Shape â†’ parent class (base class)

Circle, Rectangle â†’ child classes (derived classes)

âœ… Code Example
# Base class
class Shape:
    def area(self):
        return 0  # default (no specific shape)

# Derived class: Circle
class Circle(Shape):
    def __init__(self, radius):
        self.radius = radius

    def area(self):
        return 3.14 * self.radius * self.radius  # Ï€rÂ² formula

# Derived class: Rectangle
class Rectangle(Shape):
    def __init__(self, length, width):
        self.length = length
        self.width = width

    def area(self):
        return self.length * self.width  # length Ã— width formula

# Test the classes
circle1 = Circle(5)
rectangle1 = Rectangle(4, 6)

print("Circle Area:", circle1.area())
print("Rectangle Area:", rectangle1.area())
